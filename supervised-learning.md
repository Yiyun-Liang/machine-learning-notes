# Supervised learning

### Definition
"right answers" are given in the dataset. There is a relationship between the input and the output.

#### Problems 
__Regression__: Predict continuous valued output (eg. housing price)

eg. You have a large inventory of identical items. You want to predict how many of these items will sell over the next 3 months.

eg. Given a picture of a person, we have to predict their age on the basis of the given picture

__Classification__: Discrete valued output (eg. 0 or 1 or more)

eg. A software that examines individual customer accounts, and for each account decide if it has been hacked/compromised.

eg. Given a patient with a tumor, we have to predict whether the tumor is malignant or benign.
