# Unsupervised learning

### Definition
Unsupervised learning allows us to approach problems with little or no idea what our results should look like. We can derive structure from data where we don't necessarily know the effect of the variables.

We can derive this structure by clustering the data based on relationships among the variables in the data.

With unsupervised learning there is no feedback based on the prediction results.

#### Problems
Here is the dataset, find some pattern or structure (eg. clusters).

eg. Google news group and display all website urls related to a specific story together.

Cocktail Party Problem

eg. Two speakers, two microphones, both microphones recorded two overlapping voices. Give these two audio sources to a algorithm which will separate the two audios.
